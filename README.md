In this repo, we have to set up the Visual Studio Code, the Visual Studio Code is an Microsoft Code Editor, or an IDE (Interface of Development Environment), in this IDE, you can do anything you want in the development, as: <br />
- Edit some code with support of a lot of programming languages;<br />
- Integrated bash;<br />
- Version control.<br />


To download the VS Code, you must have access this <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">link</a>.

### Some useful shortcuts in the VS Code

You can use the shortcut **_Ctrl + P_** or **_Command + P_** to search archives as big projects or in projects with a lot of archives.

You can use the shortcut **_Ctrl + Shift + P_** or **_Command + Shift + P_** to run commands lines in the VS Code, an example of command is the force refresh, that reload the VS Code in case of the VS Code is crashing.

For select multpli lines, you can use some shortcuts:

- **With the mouse:** _Alt + Click_ or _Option + Click_
- **With the arrows keys up and down:** _Alt + Ctrl + Click_ or _Option + Command + Click_
- **How to do find for the next occurences:** _Ctrl + D_ or _Command + D_

For making the refactoration in the code we can use the _f2_

How to use the integrated bash? <br />
Nowadays, it is very common to need the terminal for tasks such as running tests or some build task, and VSCode has an integrated terminal that can be very useful to avoid switching between tabs and increase productivity.

### Pre commit review
Nowadays, I find it much easier to review all the files I've edited before committing, given the colorization that VSCode does on top of what you've deleted and what you've added.

It's important to be careful with this feature, as it can make it much harder to switch tools in the future (which is how I couldn't adapt to Web Storm).

### Clearer conflict resolution
Whoever has never resolved a merge conflict incorrectly, let him cast the first stone. I've been lost a lot with this and today, using VSCode, I feel much more secure, because their interface for interacting with Git processes shines!

Take a look at this image and I invite you to test it with any conflict that you may be resolving now (or later).

- [Git Lens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) Is's basically a Git Blame integrated with your code
- [Gitignore](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=codezombiech.gitignore) This plugin adds an support to you work with the Git Ignore in the VS Code
